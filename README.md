# Movies Data Analysis

Welcome to the Movies Data Analysis repository! Here, we explore various data science projects using a dataset containing information about movies.

### Dataset
We use a dataset (movies_dataset.csv) that includes details such as name, rating, genre, year, score, votes, director, writer, star, country, budget, gross, company, and runtime.

### Projects Overview

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset's characteristics and visualize trends.
2. **Predictive Modeling - Box Office Success:** Predict the box office success of movies using regression techniques.
3. **Genre Classification:** Classify movies into different genres based on their attributes.
4. **Sentiment Analysis of Reviews:** Analyze audience sentiments towards movies using NLP techniques.
5. **Recommendation System:** Build a complex movie recommendation system to suggest movies to users.
6. **Time Series Analysis:** Analyze trends and patterns in movie releases over time.
7. **Market Basket Analysis:** Identify associations between different genres of movies.

### Notebooks

Each project is implemented in Google Colabs notebooks (or Jupiter) or RMarkdown files, located in the 'notebooks' directory.
